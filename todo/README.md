# Why you din`t write documentation on readme file?
## All project have readme file to see how run the app checking the app also read about component.
### component made for what? 
###  How use component.
### Note about component.
### and every think about component and your project

### also you MUST have getting start. I will write for you an example at the end this readme file.

---

## `about  your project :`
#### UI you project is very good I like it. but your project have bug.
#### I expect after add a todo, input todo be empty 
#### also search in the list input doesn't work
---
#### `Note:` in html file is default comment and some link in the head tag for icon is better delete it and your html file be clean and readable.

## `Note1:` write readme file is important so try write good readme file if you want learn about it search for 
```bash
 how write readme file
``` 
### this is a sample of readme file if you want click on sample
[sample](https://github.com/pouryaghazizadeh/react-app-aps1/tree/main/client)

## `Note2:` IT is very very IMPORTANT write reuseable component for this component is ok dont be reuseable but for task frontend and website APS you must write reuseable component.
## `Note3:` please check the all components and read comments. good luck :)
